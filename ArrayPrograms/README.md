# A Collection of Java Array Programs ☕

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Java programs designed to practice and demonstrate various operations on arrays and matrices. Each program is self-contained in its own directory and focuses on a specific algorithm or task, making it easy to study and understand individual concepts.

This project is excellent for anyone learning Java, preparing for technical interviews, or looking for clear examples of common array-based algorithms.

## 📂 Programs Included

The table below lists all the programs currently available in this repository. Each program's directory contains the `.java` source file, the compiled `.class` file, and a `.png` screenshot of a sample run.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run any of these programs on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

### Running the Programs

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/nevinshine/javaprograms>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the program's directory.** For example, to run the Binary Search program:
    ```bash
    cd javaprograms/ArrayPrograms/"Binary Search"
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java source file:**
    ```bash
    javac BinarySearch.java
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled Java class:**
    ```bash
    java BinarySearch
    ```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.
